# Friday Night Funkin' - Flavor Rave

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).

Open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`

After it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install most of the needed libraries.

hxvlc doesn't work properly with Haxe Module Manager, so it must also be installed separately from this repository:
`haxelib install hxvlc 1.2.0`

Afterwards, you're ready to compile!
