Eyeliner and Eyes Shadowed 


*Spicy is browsing the make-up section of New Togarashi's largest cosmetics shop. She eyes the eyeliner section up and down for a few minutes, trying to find a specific brand. Her prolonged searching catches the attention of another shopper, who finds her struggle amusing. They approach the eyeliner section and immediately grab a bold, black eyeliner set and place it in Spicy's hand.* 

????: Zest's Best is the only brand here you need to worry about. No other brand is gonna give you results worth presenting. 

*Spicy looks up at ???? in surprise. ???? runs her hand through her blond hair and twirls her ponytail, all while smirking down at the plucky redhead standing next to her. Spicy could immediately notice her impeccable make-up work, trusting her judgements on the brand she had chosen for her.* 

????: Just thought I'd spare you wasting any more time. 

Spicy: Ooh, thank you! This stuff does look really good! 

*Spicy closes her eyes and briefly pictures herself rocking the slick black eyeliner before remembering her reason for coming to the shop* 

Spicy: Ah, but I'm not shopping for myself today. Just helping a buddy out, and they have a specific color they like. I can't find it anywhere here though! 

????: Then I encourage you to give them this instead, and they'll immediately see how much better the results are. 

Spicy: Hmm... does this brand come in red? 

????: ...red? 

*???? seemed very baffled by the color choice. She reeled back a bit in shock, before letting out a humored sigh and returning to normal* 

????: Honey, you'll be damned to find any brand producing red eyeliner anymore. The trends have been set, and we're long past the bold and bizzare phase when that was on shelves. 

*"I think you and your little buddy would have better luck finding that in a cheap Halloween store" ???? murmurs to herself with a smirk.* 

Spicy: There's gotta be something here. No way it's just all black... 

*Spicy rummages through the shelves, looking behind several of the boxed sets. She reaches far in the back and grabs one that looked different from the rest.* 

Spicy: There, I found it! And lookie, it's even the brand you said too! 

*Spicy waves a box of bold, red eyeliner in the air in excitement. ???? pursed her lips, seeing the unusual product still on shelves. Something about it felt familiar, too; A feeling that rubbed her the wrong way.* 

Spicy: Aha, I know Smoky's gonna love this! 

*???? turned up her nose upon hearing that name. The pieces quickly fit into place in her head. She had heard that her former bandmate had started anew and was back on the scene, and was baffled to see that the young, unprofessional looking girl in front if her was part of it. She scoffed for a second, but her tinge of disgust morphed into a sly smile. She leaned forward, placing her hand on Spicy's shoulder.*

????: Ooh, I see. So you must be Smoky's new fling, hmm? 

Spicy: Fling? N-no, aha! It's not like that. We're just good friends! A-and a totally rockin' duo too! Wait... you know Smoky? 

????: Quite well. He's quite the character, isn't he? Don't you find his mysterious, stoic nature so alluring? 

*???? nonchalantly rolled her eyes, grinning sarcastically* 

Spicy: That's just how he presents himself on stage. He's not like that to me. He's really kind and cares a lot about me and others. Especially when I get clumsy and break my guitar, eheheh... 

*???? gives a snooty laugh* 

????: Ahaha, he really does have a type, huh? 

Spicy: Hey, I said it's not like that! And what do you mean he has a type? 

????: Has he never told you about his *old* buddies? He must have if you two are so close. 

Spicy: We are! Though I don't think he's ever mentioned that- 

????: So he's still as closed off as ever. 

Spicy: It just... never came up, I guess. 

*"Is she one of his old friends? She's not at all the type of person Smoky would hang with." Spicy thought to herself. ????'s strange statements were throwing her for a loop* 

????: I think he would've if he was as you say. That closed off mind of his isn't a stage act. 

Spicy: Hey, I'm just here to buy him a gift! I'm not gonna pry into his personal business. 

*Spicy fiddles with her wallet, pulling out just enough to afford the eyeliner.* 

????: Well, then this should be an easy question to answer. What instrument does Smoky play? 

Spicy: Shamisen. That's always been his signature. 

????: Just the shamisen? 

Spicy: Yeah. I haven't seen any other instruments at his place before. 

*???? stares deadpan at Spicy. Mass frustration built inside of her upon hearing Spicy's response. Without breaking eye contact, she plucked the red eyeliner out of Spicy's hands and placed the black eyeliner she originally had back in them. She tilted her head with her smug smile crawling back on her face.* 

????: Don't waste your money on him. He's never been appreciative of gifts. 

*???? tosses the red eyeliner far back behind the shelf and walks off* 

*Spicy couldn't register what had just happened or what that whole interaction was about. Who the hell was that chick? She looked down at the black eyeliner, hesitating for a sec, before reach back and grabbing the red eyeliner and putting the black one back on the shelf. She used the last of her money to purchase it and left the store. She was still excited to give him the gift, though now more questions were on her mind.* 

*Back in the store, ???? had pulled out her phone, tapping her contacts and placing a call on a name at the top of her contacts.* 

????: Yeah, it's me, hun. Just calling to let you know that I've learned a lot about our old friend.
